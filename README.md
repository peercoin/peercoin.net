### Issues
Content requests, bug reports, etc. are all handled through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/peercoin/peercoin.net/issues). 
</br> We will try to get to your issue as soon as possible.

### Pull Requests
If you have a simple proposed change for the website, we would ask that you create a [pull request](https://github.com/peercoin/peercoin.net/pulls) instead of an issue. This includes things like link changes, text errors and other minor cosmetic fixes. 
We can immediately add these to the live site by simply accepting the pull request, which makes everything much easier.
