                            Peercoin (PPC) first came online in 2012, making it one of the earliest
                            pioneering blockchains. The key innovation of Peercoin is its invention
                            of proof-of-stake, an alternative consensus protocol to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work. <br/><br/>
                            Proof-of-work blockchains are secured by proving the consumption of a costly
                            limited resource: electricity. Proof-of-stake replaces this expensive security
                            protocol by utilizing an alternative scarce resource: time.<br/><br/>
                            Due to the cost efficient nature of proof-of-stake’s time based consensus rules,
                            Peercoin is capable of allowing any network connected computer to participate in
                            the blockchain’s security process. This efficiency strengthens Peercoin by growing
                            the number of security providers and ensuring that security can be sustained over the long-term.

                        <h1 class="titlethick">User Governance</h1>
                        <p class="desc">
                            In Peercoin, coin owners (stakeholders) are the ones who wield influence over
                            the network, produce new blocks, and secure the chain. Stakeholders of Peercoin
                            co-own the blockchain and collectively decide its future through protocol voting.<br/><br/>
                            Voting is carried out the same way Peercoin is secured, through a process called
                            proof-of-stake minting. Stakeholders participate in minting simply by installing
                            the version of Peercoin they support, loading their wallet with PPC, and holding
                            them while they are occasionally selected by Peercoin’s protocol to mint the next
                            block in the chain. Every minted block rewards stakeholders with new PPC and a vote.<br/><br/>
                            This makes Peercoin the first blockchain capable of allowing its protocol rules to
                            be governed directly by its users, making for a network that is more decentralized,
                            democratic, and easily secured by people around the world.

                        <p class="desc">
                            Given that the blockchain is immutable by its very nature and all recorded data
                            is stored forever, chain bloat becomes an escalating problem at higher usage
                            levels which harms both security and the ability of the network to scale. <br/><br/>
                            To preserve the trustless security of the blockchain and ensure its ability to scale
                            to global usage levels, Peercoin’s inventors tailored the blockchain and its economics
                            to fulfill the specific role of base layer settlement network.<br/><br/>
                            This role focuses Peercoin development on modularity, keeping the protocol simple and
                            secure with as few features as possible, while maintaining the blockchain as a stable
                            base upon which any number of additional layers can be built on top.<br/><br/>
                            Rather than being coded directly into the blockchain protocol itself, features like
                            tokens and smart contracts are developed as secondary layer protocols that exist on
                            top of Peercoin. Building additional functionality as separate, independent layers
                            helps protect the base layer blockchain from exposure to new exploits and prevents
                            chain bloat by allowing for off-chain scaling solutions.

                        <h1 class="titlethick">Fair Distribution</h1>
                        <p class="desc">
                            Effective cryptocurrencies have fair distributions that are wide enough to
                            ensure the overall coin supply does not get concentrated into the hands of
                            too few people. This is especially important for a cryptocurrency like
                            Peercoin where stakeholders are responsible for securing the network.<br/><br/>
                            However a problem exists for blockchains that are run purely on proof-of-stake,
                            as there is no easy way to fairly distribute the initial coin supply. In a pure
                            proof-of-stake network, the entire coin supply is created from scratch by the
                            project maintainer, who then chooses which individuals get to own stake. This
                            manual distribution process often ends in a network with highly centralized security.<br/><br/>
                            To solve this problem, Peercoin’s founders utilized proof-of-stake for network
                            security and proof-of-work for distribution. Proof-of-work miners are rewarded
                            with new PPC generated by the network. This newly mined PPC is then sold on
                            exchanges by miners for profit and purchased by new stakeholders who can use
                            it to mint blocks by participating in proof-of-stake minting.<br/><br/>
                            So while proof-of-stake provides security directly, proof-of-work is designed
                            to do so indirectly by strengthening the decentralization of the network through
                            a wider distribution of PPC to new potential minters. This continual distribution
                            works to grow the number of security providers over time.

                            blockchain network that is primarily focused on maximizing decentralization.<br/><br/>
                            This primary focus works to preserve the trustless, immutable and censorship
                            resistant nature of Peercoin so that it can always be relied upon to fulfill its
                            core role as a distributed mechanism for securely storing all types of value.<br/><br/>
                            This value can be anything from fiat wealth being stored in PPC, to data being stored
                            on the chain in the form of tokens, records, or contracts. Regardless of the type of
                            value that is being stored, Peercoin was built with the fundamentals in mind to always
                            ensure that your data remains safe and secure.

                                                    The use of Proof-of-stake mining in Peercoin is efficient because network security is not dependent on the use of massive amounts of electrical energy (proof-of-energy-burn). Instead minters invest their coins and time to emulate the PoW process. <br><br>This is done by simply opening up their wallet app, sending coins to their address and letting them sit there while they are occasionally selected by the protocol to mint the next block. This process is both energy and cost efficient.<br><br>
                                                    You can find more information on minting in the <a href="https://docs.peercoin.net/#/peercoin-minting-behaviour" class="intext">Peercoin documentation.</a>

                                                    Peercoin uses the hashcash double iterated SHA-256 algorithm for Proof-of-Work mining. This means anything that any hardware that can mine Bitcoin can mine Peercoin as well.<br><br>
